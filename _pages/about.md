## About Me

I am Rui Ge, an undergraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), where I am pursuing my studies with a focus on cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence and federated learning. My academic journey is driven by a passion for innovative problem-solving and advancing technology through collaborative and interdisciplinary approaches.

## Research Experience

- **Adaptive Multi-Agent System Generation with Large Language Models** (Nov 2024 - Feb 2025)  
  As a Researcher under Prof. Siheng Chen at SJTU and Shanghai AI Lab, I proposed a novel framework for automating multi-agent workflow generation using large language models, enhancing structured coordination for complex reasoning tasks.

- **Towards Context-Aware LLM Agent: Data Pruning for Sensor Data Comprehension** (Oct 2024 - Feb 2025)  
  As the Main Researcher under Prof. Zhenzhe Zheng at SJTU, I designed a technique to map sensor data into semantic space with data pruning, reducing inference costs while enabling LLMs to interpret sensor data effectively.

- **Synthetic Data Generation from Unstructured Text for Federated Instruction Tuning** (Jul 2024 - Oct 2024)  
  As the Main Researcher under Prof. Siheng Chen, I developed FedIT-U2S, a framework transforming unstructured text into high-quality instruction data for federated learning, eliminating the need for manual annotation.

- **Real-World Benchmarks for Federated Large Language Models** (Jan 2024 - Jun 2024)  
  As the Main Researcher under Prof. Siheng Chen, I created FedLLLM-Bench, the first benchmark suite for federated large language models, integrating diverse corpora to evaluate performance under realistic constraints.
